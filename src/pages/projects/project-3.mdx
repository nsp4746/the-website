projdates: "September 2024"
description: "Researched how to create and run a neural network via Tensorflow to detect DDoS attacks. 
The model was trained on a dataset of thousands samples and achieved an accuracy of 99%. The model used the algorithm random-forest from 
scikit-learn, and the dataset was from the CICIDS 2017 Friday DDoS dataset."
