## What I've Accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: I was able to download and properly configure AstroHTML

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to create and route to new pages

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! It's written in Markdown! 

## What's next
I will finish the Astro tutorial and continue to build and expand on this website
